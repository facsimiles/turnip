turnip
======

turnip is a flexible and scalable Git server suite written in Python
using Twisted.

The various servers provide customisable virtual hosting, with flexible
authentication and authorisation, and individual horizontal scaling from
the frontend to the storage layer.

None of the Python interfaces here should be considered stable.
